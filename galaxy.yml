# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that should not be included in the build artifact.
# A pattern is matched from the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory.
# This uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories.
# Some directories and files like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered
